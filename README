# 🤖 AI Story Generator using GPT-2 Medium

This project demonstrates a simple and effective **AI-based story generator** using the **GPT-2 Medium** model from Hugging Face Transformers. Users can input a creative prompt, and the model generates a short, coherent story based on that prompt.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python 🐍
- [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) by Hugging Face 🤗
- GPT-2 Medium (124M parameters) 📖
- Kaggle / Colab (for GPU or CPU execution)

## 📦 How It Works
1. Loads a pre-trained `gpt2-medium` text generation model.
2. Accepts a user prompt (e.g., _"A time traveler visits ancient Egypt"_).
3. Generates a creative story continuation.
4. Displays the result in a clean, readable format.

## 💡 Example Prompts
- "A time traveler visits ancient Egypt"
- "The robot slowly opened the mysterious box"
- "Once upon a time in a haunted forest"
- "In a future where humans live on Mars"

## 🧪 Sample Output
The robot slowly opened the mysterious box containing the lost boy before continuing with the rest of the experiment. On the outside of the box was a blue plastic bag. Inside was a red plastic bag sealed with a white band. A red ball-shaped object was tucked away inside the ball in the bag as the researchers watched. The ball was made out of a black plastic sheet. A wire loop was on the bottom of the ball and was connected back to the outside of the box with yellow electrical tape. A tiny light shone through on the box as the researchers watched the robot perform operations.

## ✅ Features
- Uses `gpt2-medium` for improved coherence over default GPT-2
- Suppresses unnecessary warnings for clean output
- Designed for easy use in Kaggle or Jupyter notebooks
- Reproducible outputs with fixed random seed
