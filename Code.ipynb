Written by David Lynch <david@jmm.com.au>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPrompt: The robot slowly opened the mysterious box\n\nGenerated Story:\nThe robot slowly opened the mysterious box containing the lost boy before continuing with the rest of the experiment. On the outside of the box was a blue plastic bag. Inside was a red plastic bag sealed with a white band. A red ball-shaped object was tucked away inside the ball in the bag as the researchers watched. The ball was made out of a black plastic sheet. A wire loop was on the bottom of the ball and was connected back to the outside of the box with yellow electrical tape. A tiny light shone through on the box as the researchers watched the robot perform operations.\n\nAfter removing the ball, the researchers removed the box for proper inspection by the robots. While one robot was digging and another was moving about in the box, a woman heard the noise of someone opening the box\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPrompt: In a future where humans live on Mars\n\nGenerated Story:\nIn a future where humans live on Mars, perhaps the most attractive features of the Red Planet are its towering volcanic deposits, with a vast, flat landscape where Mars ice volcanism can be observed as the sun rises and sets. And there are even more exciting geologically interesting sights for visitors, such as a volcanic landscape which resembles ice cliffs carved by a rock-moving volcano, whose fissures were revealed over geological time and revealed to be made in by lava flowing directly down towards the ground and spreading up to the ceiling of the space.\n\nOne such rock-moving volcano on Mars is Kapteyn crater, which, from this angle, looks much like a volcanic formation formed by the flow of lava flowing from a volcanic source in Antarctica.\n\n\nHow hot is Mars?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPrompt: Once upon a time in a haunted forest\n\nGenerated Story:\nOnce upon a time in a haunted forest, a boy was kidnapped, tortured, and left on the brink of death. When he later emerged from the fog, he encountered a woman standing just beyond a forest's edge, and together they began to make a name for themselves for rescuing his friends and hunting down his kidnappers.\n\nA film was soon released to compete with this. Director Richard Matheson's film A Very Short Walk—adapted by Christopher McQuarry from the book and screenplay of the same name—is so successful (at least in America) that, according to some reports, McQuarry received an Oscar for best screenplay in a feature length movie in 1991. It has been released into over 60 international markets, and is currently on view in the U.S.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPrompt: Flim flam foo\n\nGenerated Story:\nFlim flam foo foobar\n\nFrofln is a word used to define a single line\n\nFlap flap fla fray frick flop Flop out flop Out\n\nFlam flam fly flah flam flamm flam muck flam muck flam oo go Fly to go out\n\nFlam flam fly flah flam flam flam muck flam muck flam oo go Fly to go out\n\nFlange flan flang flan Flang flap flap flap flanged flap flang flang flap flang flap flang flap\n\nFlang is a compound verb from the verb flah, meaning 'flaunt',\n\n\"To throw the wind at a wind\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":8}]}
